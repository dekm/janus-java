License

The UNIGRID daemon and wallet are released under the terms of the GNU Affero GPL license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more information.

Development process
-------------------
Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't match the project's coding conventions or are controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/unigrid-project/janus/tags) are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions.

Automated Testing
-----------------
Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for old code.
